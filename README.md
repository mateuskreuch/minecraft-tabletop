# Tabletop

Tabletop is a Minecraft mod which adds interactivity-oriented content, allowing you to create games inside Minecraft. Tabletop is a heavily multiplayer-focused mod.

Currently, Tabletop adds:

- **Blobs**: A small, dummy entity that can be placed and picked-up by right clicking. It can be named, colored and dispensed. More than one can occupy the same block.
- **Honeyball**: Right clicking on a block picks it up and stores it. Right clicking again places it back. Shift + right clicking swaps blocks.
- **Soul Compass**: On activation, it makes nearby players glow and remembers the current position, pointing to it until activated again.
- **Overstuffed Firework Rockets**: Removes the limit of 3 gunpowder while crafting fireworks. Surpassing that limit gives the Overstuffed buff, which makes the rocket destroy blocks when it explodes.
- **Hoe of Echo**: A sculk-tool that consumes experience to instamine blocks, losing the drops.
- **Redstone Meter**: A simple digital display of redstone power.
- **Phantom Prism**: Gives all 16 different colors according to redstone power.
